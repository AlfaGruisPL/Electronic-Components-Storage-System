# Engineering work - electronic parts storage system

The project was developed for my engineering thesis, which I co-created with my girlfriend Kornelia. It consisted of several parts, with me responsible for the mobile application, database, and API.

The goal of this project was to create a university electronic parts inventory system for the Faculty of Electronics. It utilized QR codes attached to individual electronic components, which could then be scanned and located in the system using the mobile application.

The application also enabled users to take photos of the components, borrow them, transfer them between locations, and search for items in the system.

* The mobile application was written using the IONIC framework with Angular.
* The database was based on MySQL.
* The API was written in PHP.
